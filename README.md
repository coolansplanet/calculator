# Calculator

#### How to run it:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open the CLI, go to the root directory of the project and run `npm install` (NodeJS and npm must be installed on your system for this step).

3. Run `npm start` to load the server.

4. If your default browser didn't open automatically at this point, open it and go to <http://localhost:3000> in oder to see the website working.

4. If you want to test it, just run `npm test` in your CLI. You'll also see a **coverage report** (requested as bonus point) on the CLI itself or, if you prefer, you can also view it in HTML format opening the following file with your browser: `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`. [**Travis CI**](https://travis-ci.org/coolansplanet/calculator) is integrated with this project, so the project is tested and built in every push.

5. If you want to build it manually, just run `npm run build`.
